          Welcome to Kagarama Secondary School, home of legends 🤣. Nestor, the comeback king, shuts down haters with words smoother than butter 🧈🧠. Angelo once broke a world record (or maybe just a chair) by eating <strong>25 donuts</strong> in one sitting 🍩😮. Kalisa? He’s the <em>kawunga king</em> — ate <strong>50kg in one day</strong> and still asked for more 😳🍛. And me? I just try to survive lunch without becoming a meme 📸😂. Together, we’re the squad no one forgets.
